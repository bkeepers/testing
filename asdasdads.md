* I started out with [`blahtexml`](https://github.com/gvanas/blahtexml), which takes
TeX equations and converts them to PNG. This wasn't a bad idea, but it took too long;
for twelve equations, it took eight seconds. It was slow because it shelled out
to [`LaTeX`](http://www.latex-project.org/), *then* [`dvipng`](http://www.nongnu.org/dvipng/).  
In fact, as I discovered, most projects on the 'Net shell out to `LaTeX`, then
something else, which makes performance absolutely horrid. I had to find something
better, with preferably no dependency on `LaTeX`.

* [`mimetex`](http://www.forkosh.com/mimetex.html) was my next attempt. It looked
great: a pure C implementation that turned TeX equations into a rasterized representation,
and then into a PNG. The speed was there, but the output image was pretty jagged.
I tweaked the program to output BMPs, and tried to sharpen those with [`potrace`](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/),
but the results were less then pleasant. The "update" to `mimetex` is [`mathtex`](http://www.forkosh.com/mathtex.html),
but it, too, depend on `LaTeX` and `dvipng` binaries to produce images.
